# Todo App Migration Test

This repository is a **testing playground** created to experiment with different **Angular migration scenarios**.
It is **not intended for production use**, but rather to validate schematics, run edge case experiments, and ensure migration strategies work as expected before applying them in real projects.

## Purpose

* Test and validate **Angular schematics** and **custom migrations**.
* Explore how code evolves under different migration strategies.
* Provide a controlled environment for trial and error without affecting real applications.

## Notes

* The project structure may look like a standard Todo app, but its main goal is **migration testing**.
* Code and commits may be incomplete, experimental, or intentionally broken to test behaviors.

## Usage

Clone the repo and run the standard Angular commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then apply the migration or schematic you want to test against this codebase.
